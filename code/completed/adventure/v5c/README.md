# Adventure V5c

## Proposed Changes

- Use a Strategy pattern for action selection
- Use an Observer to notify the player of actions that were performed

## Implementation notes

- The `Action` class also demonstrates, how you can implement "polymorphic"
  operators: Implement the operator in a superclass and call a virtual method.
