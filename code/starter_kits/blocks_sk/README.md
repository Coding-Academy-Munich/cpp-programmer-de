# Raylib Refactoring Example

This is the code for a refactoring workshop. It contains a simple game written
in C++ using the [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) library.

The master branch contains a version of the game that is not particularly well
factored, and the goal of the workshop is to refactor it into something that is
easier to extend and maintain.

The code is based on the original C code of the
[raylib intro course](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib-intro-course)
graciously made available by Ramon Santamaria. I've converted it
roughly to C++ and modified the implementation to make it more interesting
to refactor.
